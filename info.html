					them all at once?
					Well with Synergy you can link all of your favorite services together. Not only will it be easier to access your services, you will
					also stay connected. Whenever you upload a picture, put out a tweet, update your status, or share music, it will notify your friends 
					that it came from Synergy. You can do it all on Synergy.

				Synergy doesn't store any of your information, we just recieve it from the service and display it to you. Synergy lets you set 
				security questions in case you forgot your password or username. Not only are you secured using Synergy, but you also recieve 
				the security from the social web sites.

				Each application functions with the speed of the actual service. You won't feel any difference when on Synergy from the actual web
				site. No lag, no problems. Same speed even when on multiple web services at the same time.
